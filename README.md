# The Community Connector Platform

## Project Overview

The Community Connector is a hyper-local online platform designed to connect residents within defined geographic communities (e.g., apartment complexes, gated communities, neighborhoods in Bengaluru) with local service providers who also reside within the same community. The platform fosters community engagement, builds trust, and provides convenient access to services that might otherwise go undiscovered among neighbors.

## Core Features

### Hyper-Local Focus
- Platform operates strictly within predefined residential communities
- All services offered and sought are within specific community boundaries

### Service Discovery
- Residents can discover services offered by neighbors
- Service providers can list their offerings to the community

### Trust and Quality Assurance
- Community-driven review system
- Identity and residency verification for both providers and customers
- User-initiated reviews with 1-5 star ratings and text comments

### Categorization System
- Multi-layered, dynamic categorization (Broad Categories, Sub-Categories, Tags/Keywords)
- Dynamic forms based on service category
- Search and filter by keyword, category, and hyper-local geo-location

## Key Constraints

### No Platform-Facilitated Payments
- The platform does NOT process, hold, or mediate financial transactions
- All payments occur off-platform, directly between customer and provider

### Desktop Web Application MVP
- Initial MVP is a web application optimized for desktop browsers
- No mobile app version for the MVP

### Location
- Initial target market: Residential communities in Bengaluru, Karnataka, India

## Service Scope

The platform facilitates the exchange of services, not direct product sales:

- **Home Services**: Handyman, Cleaning, Pet Care, Babysitting, Gardening, Appliance Repair, Plumbing, Electrician
- **Skills & Education**: Tutoring, Language Lessons, Music Classes, Yoga/Fitness Instruction, Computer Skills
- **Food & Culinary**: Home-cooked Meals, Baked Goods, Speciality Food Items, Catering
- **Personal Care & Wellness**: Haircutting, Beauty Services, Massage Therapy
- **Creative & Craft**: Custom Artwork, Handmade Items, Photography, Event Decor, Digital Design
- **Errands & Logistics**: Grocery Shopping, Local Deliveries, Package Drop-off/Pickup
- **Professional Services**: Basic Tech Support, Accounting Help, Writing/Editing

## Monetization Strategy

- Revenue exclusively from Service Providers (Sellers)
- Customers use the platform completely free of charge
- Monthly subscription model for service providers
- Integration with third-party subscription billing API (e.g., Razorpay, Stripe)

## MVP Focus

The MVP will focus strictly on core functionality to prove the concept rapidly, excluding:

- Complex scheduling
- Advanced analytics
- Real-time notifications beyond essential
- Complex dispute resolution for services
- Multiple provider subscription tiers
- Mobile app version

## Deployment Guide

### Deploying to Vercel

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - A Vercel account
   - Git repository with your project
   - MongoDB Atlas database (or other MongoDB provider)

2. **Environment Setup**:
   - Create a `.env.local` file with your environment variables
   - Make sure to set `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_EXPIRE`, and `JWT_COOKIE_EXPIRE`
   - Set `NODE_ENV=production`

3. **Vercel Configuration**:
   - The project includes a `vercel.json` configuration file that sets up:

     - Build commands for both client and server

4. **Deployment Steps**:
   - Push your changes to your Git repository
   - Import your project in the Vercel dashboard
   - Set your environment variables in the Vercel project settings
   - Deploy the project

5. **Troubleshooting**:
   - If build fails, check the build logs for specific errors
   - Ensure MongoDB connection string is correct and accessible from Vercel
   - Verify all required environment variables are set in Vercel project settings
- Created data structure to support the building-unit relationship required for user registration

### API Development
- Implemented RESTful API endpoints for community management:
  - GET `/api/communities` - Retrieve all communities
